## Project Overview
GameLauncher is a mobile gaming platform built with React Native (Expo, TypeScript) that allows users to instantly play lightweight HTML5/WASM games via WebView.

## Tech Stack
- Expo SDK 53 (Managed workflow)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Navigation: React Navigation (Stack)
- Game execution: WebView (remote or local games)
- Data: games.json (game catalog)
- Caching: AsyncStorage
- Testing: jest-expo + @testing-library/react-native

## Architecture
- `/screens/` → Game list + WebView screens
- `/components/` → GameCard and other UI pieces
- `/services/` → Storage (AsyncStorage)
- `/data/games.json` → Game metadata (title, image, URL)
- `/types/` → TypeScript types

## Expectations
- Game metadata should be fetched dynamically and cached
- Games should load in WebView and gracefully handle errors
- Future games can be streamed or embedded via CDN or local bundles

## Future Extensions
- User login + favorites
- Game ratings or reviews
- Rewards, leaderboards, or challenges
