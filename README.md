```

## 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

The app tracks 4 key events for performance monitoring:
- **app_open**: App launch events
- **catalog_loaded**: Game list load performance
- **game_opened**: Individual game access
- **game_error**: Error tracking and recovery

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adding New Games
Edit `src/data/games.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "title": "Game Name",
  "image": "thumbnail-url",
  "url": "playable-game-url",
  "preferredOrientation": "portrait|landscape",
  "category": "Puzzle|Racing|Arcade|Adventure",
  "description": "Game description"
}
```

### Orientation Behavior
- **Portrait Games**: Tetris, 2048 (better for vertical gameplay)
- **Landscape Games**: Racing, Action games (better for horizontal controls)
- Orientation locks automatically when game loads
- Returns to portrait when navigating back

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

1. **App Launch** → Modern gradient header with game count
2. **Game Discovery** → Scrollable cards with categories and colors
3. **Game Selection** → Smooth orientation change + loading indicator
4. **Gameplay** → Full-screen WebView with optimized settings
5. **Error Handling** → Custom screens with retry/go-back options
6. **Navigation** → Seamless back to portrait game list
