# Tasks for PRD â€“ MVP (Phase 1)

Based on analysis of the PRD requirements and current codebase state, here are the high-level tasks needed to complete the MVP implementation:

## High-Level Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 **Enhance Game Catalog Display & Caching**
  - Improve pull-to-refresh functionality and caching strategy to meet <500ms performance requirement

- [ ] 2.0 **Implement Comprehensive Error Handling & Retry Logic** 
  - Add robust error handling with retry options, go-back functionality, and offline fallback

- [ ] 3.0 **Add Landscape Orientation Support**
  - Implement landscape orientation lock for game view screen as required by PRD

- [ ] 4.0 **Implement Analytics & Event Logging System**
  - Create logging infrastructure for required events: `app_open`, `catalog_loaded`, `game_opened`, `game_error`

- [ ] 5.0 **WebView Optimization & Performance**
  - Optimize WebView configuration and loading performance to meet PRD requirements

- [ ] 6.0 **Testing & Quality Assurance**
  - Implement testing to meet >99% crash-free requirement and validate acceptance criteria

---

## Current State Assessment

**âœ… Already Implemented:**
- Basic game list screen with AsyncStorage caching
- WebView-based game execution  
- Stack navigation between screens
- Basic error handling with alerts

**ðŸ”§ Needs Enhancement:**
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- Landscape orientation support
- Event logging/analytics
- Performance optimizations
- Offline fallback improvements

## Relevant Files

- `src/screens/GameListScreen.tsx` - Main game catalog screen requiring pull-to-refresh and performance optimizations
- `src/screens/GameViewScreen.tsx` - Game WebView screen needing orientation lock and enhanced error handling
- `src/services/storageService.ts` - Caching service requiring performance improvements and offline fallback
- `src/services/analyticsService.ts` - New service for event logging (to be created)
- `src/components/GameCard.tsx` - Game card component that may need loading states
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error boundary component for crash prevention (to be created)
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Navigation setup that may need orientation configuration
- `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions that may need analytics event types
- `src/utils/orientation.ts` - Orientation utilities (to be created)
- `package.json` - May need additional dependencies for orientation control
- `app.json` - Expo configuration for orientation settings

### Notes

- Use `expo-screen-orientation` for orientation control
- Consider `@react-native-community/netinfo` for network status
- Event logging can use simple console.log initially, then upgrade to analytics service
- Test on both iOS and Android for orientation behavior
